  <h2 class="title">Linting and Formatting Practice</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Linting</h3>
    <p>
      Run <code>npm run lint</code> to execute ESLint on the entire project.
      This will check your code for style and quality issues based on the ESLint
      configuration.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Formatting</h3>
    <p>
      Run <code>npm run format</code> to format all files in the project using
      Prettier. This will apply the formatting rules defined in the Prettier
      configuration.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Linting and Formatting Combined</h3>
    <p>
      Run <code>npm run lint-and-format</code> to execute both ESLint and
      Prettier, ensuring that your code adheres to both linting and formatting
      standards.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Pre-commit Hooks</h3>
    <p>
      Husky is set up to run linting and formatting scripts before each commit.
      This ensures that code quality checks are enforced automatically.

    <h3>ESLint Rules</h3>
    <p>
      Here are some of the key rules configured in this projectâ€™s ESLint setup:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>no-console:</strong> Warns when <code>console.log</code> and
        other console methods are used. It helps keep the codebase clean and
        avoids leaving debugging statements in production code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>quotes:</strong> Enforces the use of single quotes for strings.
        Consistent quoting improves code readability and reduces potential
        errors when dealing with mixed quotes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>no-unused-vars:</strong> Warns about variables that are defined
        but never used in the code. This helps to clean up the code and remove
        unnecessary variables that could cause confusion or clutter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>eqeqeq:</strong> Enforces the use of strict equality (
        <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>) instead of loose equality (
        <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>). This avoids type coercion issues
        that can lead to unexpected behavior in the code.
      </li>
    </ul>
